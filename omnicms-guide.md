 "Folders" are for organizing (content), "sections" are subsites with a new left side navigation. 

- A 'section' contains webpages. 
Visit the [OmniCMS Support Site](https://support.moderncampus.com/learn-omni-cms/sections-folders/) to learn how to create a section and a folder.

- A 'folder' can contain documents or images. 
  (Example: /images/yourdirectory/image.jpg)
