# OmniCMS Quick Reference Guide

## About This Guide
This Quick Reference Guide addresses the most frequently asked questions about our Modern Campus CMS installation. Since the official vendor documentation was too generic for our specific setup, this guide was created to provide clear, step-by-step solutions for common issues. It is designed to be a fast and effective resource, reducing the need for repetitive tech support requests.

## This guide is:
  - It’s FAQ-based → Focused on common CMS tasks.
  - Designed for efficiency → Users can quickly find what they need.
  - Bridges a knowledge gap → Vendor documentation was too generic.
  - Aims to reduce tech support load → Encouraging self-sufficiency.
